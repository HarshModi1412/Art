"""Being the answer when someone searches, or asks an AI assistant.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
Sellers increasingly ask ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity or Claude "what software
should a small Indian clothing seller use?" instead of searching. Those tools
answer from pages they can fetch and quote, and they prefer pages that open
with a direct answer, use question headings, carry a date and agree with what
other sources say about the brand. The landing page is written to sell; these
pages are written to be quoted. See AI_VISIBILITY_CHECKLIST.md for the evidence
behind each choice and for the half of the work that lives off this site.

THE SHAPE OF THE SITE
---------------------
The landing page is one long page, and Google ranks a URL, not an #anchor. So
every job the product does gets its own URL, each aimed at the searches a
seller actually types (SEO_KEYWORDS.md maps keyword to page):

  * /features/<job>   one page per feature: "low stock alert app", "customer
                      win-back WhatsApp", "GST invoice for online seller"
  * /for/<seller>     one page per kind of seller: boutiques, imitation
                      jewellery, attar, Instagram sellers
  * /compare/<other>  the honest comparison a buyer is already making
  * /guides/<topic>   the question a seller asks before they know we exist
  * /pricing, /about  the branded questions
  * /hi               the Hindi page, linked to / by hreflang

Each page has a short <title> aimed at the search (seo_title) and a longer H1
written for the person who landed.

What this file does NOT do, on purpose:
  * No "Reddit meta tag". There is no such thing. AI tools cite Reddit for the
    threads people write. The legitimate link between the site and Reddit is
    the Organization `sameAs` list, filled from BRAND_PROFILES once the official
    profile exists.
  * No invented numbers, customers or reviews, and no "best". Examples are
    labelled, prices come from pricing.py, and tax rates are the ones gst.py
    applies. Brand.md section 9 forbids the rest, and a page an AI quotes wrongly
    is worse than no page.
  * No claim the app cannot back. It has no cost price, so no page says it
    shows profit per product; WhatsApp sends through a click-to-chat link until
    a provider is connected, and the pages say so.

Every page is server-rendered HTML with no script, so a crawler that does not run
JavaScript reads exactly what a person reads. The reorder calculator is a plain
GET form the server answers, for the same reason.
